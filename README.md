This is my first repository made using Git command line. 

it was that easy after all.

to reiterate. 

git init (make current directory trackable via git)

git add *.cs (adds all .cs files to the staging area)
git add . (adds all files to the staging area)

git rm . (unstage all staged files)
git rm <filename> (unstage specific file)

git status (shows all stage and unstaged files)

git remote (display/manage all remote repositories)

touch <filename> (make a file)

.gitignore (contains all the files for Git to ignore)

git checkout <branchName> (checkout to branch with branchName)

git branch (displays all tracked branches)

git branch <branchName> (make a branch with filename)

git checkout <branchName> (checkout to branch)

git merge <branchName> (merge branchName towards the current branch you are on)

git push (push to remote)

git pull (pull from remote)
